	abstract = {The brain–computer interface (BCI) is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the world, with numerous applications ranging from healthcare to human augmentation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) motor imagery (MI) is among the most common BCI paradigms that have been used extensively in smart healthcare applications such as post-stroke rehabilitation and mobile assistive robots. In recent years, the contribution of deep learning (DL) has had a phenomenal impact on MI-EEG-based BCI. In this work, we systematically review the DL-based research for MI-EEG classification from the past ten years. This article first explains the procedure for selecting the studies and then gives an overview of BCI, EEG, and MI systems. The DL-based techniques applied in MI classification are then analyzed and discussed from four main perspectives: preprocessing, input formulation, deep learning architecture, and performance evaluation. In the discussion section, three major questions about DL-based MI classification are addressed: (1) Is preprocessing required for DL-based techniques? (2) What input formulations are best for DL-based techniques? (3) What are the current trends in DL-based techniques? Moreover, this work summarizes MI-EEG-based applications, extensively explores public MI-EEG datasets, and gives an overall visualization of the performance attained for each dataset based on the reviewed articles. Finally, current challenges and future directions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface (MI-BCI) provides a non-muscular channel for communication to those who are suffering from neuronal disorders. The designing of an accurate and reliable MI-BCI system requires the extraction of informative and discriminative features. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) has been potent and is widely used in BCI for extracting features in motor imagery tasks. The classifiers translate these features into device commands. Many classification algorithms have been devised, among those Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) have been widely used. In recent studies, the researchers are using deep neural networks for the classification of motor imagery tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of dominant feature extraction methods and classification algorithms in brain-computer interface for motor imagery tasks.

Several paradigms exist for developing BCIs. One of such is motor imagery (MI). MI-based BCIs have been implemented in a variety of ways. Key factors such as the device type, task paradigm, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection and classification techniques, must be properly considered in building BCIs. Also, factors such as the task at hand, target population, processing rate and usability of the online system must be considered. Considering this need, this review presents a summary of the existing techniques for motor imagery classification, stating common trends and challenges facing MI studies, with potential improvements that might be seen.

	abstract = {Motor Imagery (MI) is a voluntary modulation of brain signals for specific action without real limb movement. It is essential to classify MI signal to design a brain computer interface (BCI). BCI involves a number of signal processing steps, and a lot of techniques have been developed for each step. There can be numerous combinations of these techniques at different steps that can be employed to design a BCI. This work focuses on MI-based BCI using EEG signal and reviews the existing techniques. More importantly, a detailed comparative study is performed to explore the important combinations of methods by comparing their performance quantitatively. Often a method, which performs very good in one combination, can be bad performer in other combinations and it is a dilemma for the researchers to select appropriate methods for their desired BCI application.In our performance analysis, we have systematically included the variations of methods in each step of BCI such that it gives idea to BCI researchers how each method in one step fits best with specific combinations of methods in other steps. We have shown that how much each step is sensitive towards overall performance of the BCI system.We hope that this work helps, especially for new researchers, to provide a better guideline for designing more efficient BCI system.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The availability of large and varied Electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets, rapidly advances and inventions in deep learning techniques, and highly powerful and diversified computing systems have all permitted to easily analyzing those datasets and discovering vital information within. However, the classification process of EEG signals and discovering vital information should be robust, automatic, and with high accuracy. Motor Imagery (MI) EEG has attracted us due to its significant applications in daily life.
Methods
This paper attempts to achieve those goals throughout a systematic review of the state-of-the-art studies within this field of research. The process began by intensely surfing the well-known specialized digital libraries and, as a result, 40 related papers were gathered. The papers were scrutinized upon multiple noteworthy technical issues, among them deep neural network architecture, input formulation, number of MI EEG tasks, and frequency range of interest.
Outcomes
Deep neural networks build robust and automated systems for the classification of MI EEG recordings by exploiting the whole input data throughout learning salient features. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and hybrid-CNN (h-CNN) are the dominant architectures with high performance in comparison to public datasets with other types of architectures. The MI related datasets, input formulation, frequency ranges, and preprocessing and regularization methods were also reviewed.
Inferences
This review gives the required preliminaries in developing MI EEG-based BCI systems. The review process of the published articles in the last five years aims to help in choosing the appropriate deep neural network architecture and other hyperparameters for developing those systems.},

	abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) constitute an alternative channel of communication between humans and environment. There are a number of different technologies which enable the recording of brain activity. One of these is electroencephalography (EEG). The most common EEG methods include interfaces whose operation is based on changes in the activity of Sensorimotor Rhythms (SMR) during imagery movement, so-called Motor Imagery BCI (MIBCI).The present article is a review of 131 articles published from 1997 to 2017 discussing various procedures of data processing in MIBCI. The experiments described in these publications have been compared in terms of the methods used for data registration and analysis. Some of the studies (76 reports) were subjected to meta-analysis which showed corrected average classification accuracy achieved in these studies at the level of 51.96\%, a high degree of heterogeneity of results (Q = 1806577.61; df = 486; p {\textless} 0.001; I2 = 99.97\%), as well as significant effects of number of channels, number of mental images, and method of spatial filtering. On the other hand the meta-regression failed to provide evidence that there was an increase in the effectiveness of the solutions proposed in the articles published in recent years. The authors have proposed a newly developed standard for presenting results acquired during MIBCI experiments, which is designed to facilitate communication and comparison of essential information regarding the effects observed. Also, based on the findings of descriptive analysis and meta-analysis, the authors formulated recommendations regarding practices applied in research on signal processing in MIBCIs.},

	abstract = {Education 4.0 is looking to prepare future scientists and engineers not only by granting them with knowledge and skills but also by giving them the ability to apply them to solve real life problems through the implementation of disruptive technologies. As a consequence, there is a growing demand for educational material that introduces science and engineering students to technologies, such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI). Thus, our contribution towards the development of this material is to create a test bench for BCI given the basis and analysis on how they can be discriminated against. This is shown using different AI methods: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), allowing students to see how input changes alter their performance. These tests were done against a two-class Motor Image database. First, using a large frequency band and no ﬁltering eye movement. Secondly, the band was reduced and the eye movement was ﬁltered. The accuracy was analyzed obtaining values around 70∼80\% for all methods, excluding SVM and SOM mapping. Accuracy and mapping differentiability increased for some subjects for the second scenario 70∼85\%, meaning either their band with the most signiﬁcant information is on that limited space or the contamination because of eye movement was better mitigated by the regression method. This can be translated to saying that these methods work better under limited spaces. The outcome of this work is useful to show future scientists and engineers how BCI experiments are conducted while teaching them the basics of some AI techniques that can be used in this and other several experiments that can be carried on the framework of Education 4.0.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have achieved significant success in controlling external devices through the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. BCI-based Motor Imagery (MI) system bridges brain and external devices as communication tools to control, for example, wheelchair for people with disabilities, robotic control, and exoskeleton control. This success largely depends on the machine learning (ML) approaches like deep learning (DL) models. DL algorithms provide effective and powerful models to analyze compact and complex EEG data optimally for MI-BCI applications. DL models with CNN network have revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning from raw data. Meanwhile, RNN networks have been able to decode EEG signals by processing sequences of time series data. However, many challenges in the MI-BCI field have affected the performance of DL models. A major challenge is the individual differences in the EEG signal of different subjects. Therefore, the model must be retrained from the scratch for each new subject, which leads to computational costs. Analyzing the EEG signals is challenging due to its low signal to noise ratio and non-stationary nature. Additionally, limited size of existence datasets can lead to overfitting which can be prevented by using transfer learning (TF) approaches. The main contributions of this study are discovering major challenges in the MI-BCI field by reviewing the state of art machine learning models and then suggesting solutions to address these challenges by focusing on feature selection, feature extraction and classification methods.},
